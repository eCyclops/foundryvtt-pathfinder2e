Your targets are determined randomly by the GM. If you have no other viable targets, you target yourself, automatically hitting but not scoring a critical hit. If it’s impossible for you to attack or cast spells, you babble incoherently, wasting your actions.<br><br>Each time you take damage from an attack or spell, you can attempt a <strong>DC 11</strong> flat check to recover from your confusion and end the condition.</p>",
