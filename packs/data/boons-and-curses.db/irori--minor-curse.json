If you select a check for which you have a higher bonus when another method would have been more appropriate for the situation, such as using Deception to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ewwCglB7XOPLUz72]{Lie} through life because itâ€™s your highest modifier, even if it would be better to reach a compromise through Diplomacy, you must roll twice and take the lower result.</p>",
