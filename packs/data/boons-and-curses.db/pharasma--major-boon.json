Until you fulfill this fate, any time you would die, a grave but nonfatal misfortune instead befalls you.</p>\n<p>You take at least a full day to recuperate and you potentially face permanent consequences, but you donâ€™t die. If you would have died even once without this boon, once your fate is complete, you let out a final sigh and then die peacefully.</p>",
