When a creature enters a bargain or contract with you, uncoerced and of its own free will, it canâ€™t voluntarily violate its side of the bargain as long as you uphold your side. You can always choose to violate the bargain yourself, but if you do, the creature is no longer bound to fulfill its part.</p>",
