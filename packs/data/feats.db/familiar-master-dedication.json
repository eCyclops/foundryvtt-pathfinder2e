This might have involved complex rituals and invocations, such as meditating under the moon until something crept out of the forest. Or maybe you just did each other a good turn, such as rescuing the beast from a trap or a foe, and then being rescued in turn.</p>\n<p>Whatever the details, you are now comrades until the end. You gain a familiar (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 198). If you already have a familiar, you gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.4oagp3jjUbYhu1lY]{Enhanced Familiar} feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can&rsquo;t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the familiar master archetype.</p>",
