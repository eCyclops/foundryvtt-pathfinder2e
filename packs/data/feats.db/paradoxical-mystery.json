Each day during your daily preparations, choose one basic or advanced domain spell from any domain from the <em>Core Rulebook</em> or another domain to which you have access, or any initial or advanced revelation spell from another mystery. You gain that spell as a revelation spell until your next daily preparations, and it has the cursebound trait.</p>",
