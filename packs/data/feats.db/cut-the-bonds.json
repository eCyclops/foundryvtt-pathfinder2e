Attempt a counteract check using your attack modifier (including your multiple attack penalty) with a melee weapon with which you have expert proficiency. Your counteract level is half your level rounded up. On a success, you free that member from the effect; on a failure, you canâ€™t attempt to use Cut the Bonds on that effect on that crop member until 24 hours have passed.</p>",
