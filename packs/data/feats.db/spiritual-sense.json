This applies while Searching, while @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seeking}, and on the automatic secret check you gain while exploring even if you aren’t Searching. You can still notice spirits only on a successful check, and you can’t see them if they’re more than 5 feet inside an object.</p>\n<p>When you notice a creature with your Spiritual Sense, you also learn its location, making it @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} to you if it had been @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected}.</p>",
