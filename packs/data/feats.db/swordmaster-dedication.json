You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when foes attempt to Disarm you. If you have the Deft Cooperation feat and critically succeed on a check to Aid an allyâ€™s attack roll or skill check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus from Deft Cooperation (instead of a +1 bonus) the first time you attempt an attack roll or attempt a skill check where the bonus would apply.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Swordmaster archetype.</p>",
