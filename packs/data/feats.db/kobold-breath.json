Each creature in the area must attempt a basic saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You can’t use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4. The shape of the breath, the damage type, and the saving throw match those of your @Compendium[world.ancestry-features-apg-data-entry.NGp4KcdC5Jp4NnXx]{Draconic Exemplar}. This ability has the trait associated with the type of damage it deals.</p>",
