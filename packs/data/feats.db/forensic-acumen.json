If you prefer, you can instead attempt to Recall Knowledge about the type of creature whose body you were examining, using the appropriate skill and gaining the same circumstance bonus.</p>\n<p>The circumstance bonus increases to +3 if you have master proficiency in Medicine and +4 if you have legendary proficiency.</p>",
