During this movement you ignore difficult terrain, greater difficult terrain, and any effects that would impose a penalty to Speed.</p>\n<p>You can attempt an Athletics check instead of an Acrobatics check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} when moving across narrow surfaces or uneven ground, using the same DC. This doesnâ€™t prevent you from being harmed by hazardous terrain.</p>\n<p>You can increase the number of actions this activity takes to 3 to Stride three times instead.</p>",
