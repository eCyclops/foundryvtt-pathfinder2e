After spending a week in an environment associated with an elf heritage (such as snow for arctic elf, or a forest or jungle for woodland elf) your heritage automatically changes to become that heritage. This never causes you to change to an elf heritage that isnâ€™t related to an environment, such as @Compendium[pf2e.ancestryfeatures.ifwCISxY3xxuk5ks]{Ancient Elf}, @Compendium[pf2e.ancestryfeatures.jEtVesbqYcWGbBYk]{Seer Elf}, or @Compendium[pf2e.ancestryfeatures.1wVDYY9Wue0G5R9Q]{Whisper Elf}.</p>",
