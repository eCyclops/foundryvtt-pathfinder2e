You must have interacted with that subject in some way on the previous day, whether by reading about it, talking to someone knowledgeable on the topic, or experiencing it yourself.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can reference your notes to instead choose a Lore skill you’ve prepared before with Quick Study. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. Since this proficiency is temporary, you can’t use it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.</p>",
