If the distance you fall is no more than the height of your jump, you take no damage and land upright.</p>\n<p>When attempting a High Jump or Long Jump during a Flamboyant Leap, determine the DC using the Long Jump DCs, and increase the maximum distance to double your Speed, rather than just your Speed.</p>",
