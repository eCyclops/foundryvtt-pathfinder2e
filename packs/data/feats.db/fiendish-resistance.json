Choose one of the following energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain resistance 5 to that damage type.</p>\n<p>Though you can choose any of these, the damage type typically matches a fiend associated with your bloodline. For instance, a hellspawn might choose resistance to fire, or a pitborn with a vrock ancestor might choose resistance to electricity.</p>",
