Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn’t remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties.</p>\n<p>For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to you for being @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed}, even though you wouldn’t take the –2 circumstance penalty when defending against the attack.</p>",
