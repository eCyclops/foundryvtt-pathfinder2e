You become trained in Milling Lore and Forest Lore, or an expert if you were already trained. You can always @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.ust1jJSCZQUhBZIz]{Take Cover} when you are within forest terrain to gain cover, even if youâ€™re not next to an obstacle you can Take Cover behind. In addition, any enemy who gains standard cover from a tree gains only lesser cover against your attacks (or only standard cover, if the enemy otherwise gains greater cover).</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Turpin Rowe lumberjack archetype.</p>",
