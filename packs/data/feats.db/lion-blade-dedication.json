You become trained in your choice of Deception or Stealth and in Espionage Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You never take circumstance penalties for attempting to take a disguise of a different ancestry, age, and so on, as long as the disguised form is appropriate for your size.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>&nbsp;You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Lion Blade archetype.</p>",
