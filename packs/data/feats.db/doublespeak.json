You disguise your true meaning behind other words and phrases, relying on subtle emphasis and shared experience to convey meaning that only your allies understand.</p>\n<p>Any allies who have traveled alongside you for at least 1 full week automatically discern your meaning. Other observers must succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC to realize you are passing a secret message, and they must critically succeed to understand the message itself.</p>",
