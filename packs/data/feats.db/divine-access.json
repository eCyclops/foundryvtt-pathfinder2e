Add up to three cleric spells of your choice granted by that deity to your spell list. You can select from these spells when you add or swap spells in your spell repertoire.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat more than once. You can’t choose the same spells more than once, but you can choose a different domain or a different deity with the same domain you’ve previously selected with this feat.</p>",
