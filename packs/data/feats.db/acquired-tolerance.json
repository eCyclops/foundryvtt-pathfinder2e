Reroll the triggering check and use the second result.</p>\n<p>Once you use Acquired Tolerance, you can continue to use it against the same type of poison that day, but you can’t use it against a different type of poison until after you make your next daily preparations.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you used the reaction on a save against @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.QGXNqpP5KvSldoZz]{Giant Scorpion Venom}, you could use it again against giant scorpion venom even if it came from a different source, but you couldn’t use it against @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.KdeeRCrtsDCJLfgc]{Nettleweed Residue}, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.ca2lzxfJxvuLDrKu]{Lich Dust}, or another poison.</p>",
