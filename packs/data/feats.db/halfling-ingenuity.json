You can attempt skill actions that normally require you to be trained even if you arenâ€™t trained in that skill. If you use Halfling Luck when you fail a check for a skill with which you are untrained, you can add a proficiency bonus equal to your level, rather than 0, when you reroll the triggering skill check. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to this rerolled skill check.</p>",
