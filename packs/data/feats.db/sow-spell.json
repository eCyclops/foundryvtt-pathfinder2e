If your next action is to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} using 1 action or 2 actions, the spell instead plants itself in an adjacent square. You must make all decisions regarding the spell at the time you cast it.</p>\n<p>Within the next 10 minutes, you can direct your sown spell to sprout and produce the spell’s effects as a reaction, which is triggered when a creature enters the sown spell’s space or a square adjacent to it.</p>\n<p>You can have only one sown spell at a time, and if you don’t trigger the spell within 10 minutes, it dissipates and the spell is lost. A creature can notice the sown spell with a successful Perception check against your spell DC.</p>",
