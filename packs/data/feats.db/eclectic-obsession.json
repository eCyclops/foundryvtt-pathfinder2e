You reflect on snippets you’ve learned to temporarily become trained in one Lore skill of your choice. This proficiency lasts for 10 minutes or until you critically fail a check with that skill. Since this training is temporary, you can’t use it as a prerequisite for a permanent character option like a feat or a skill increase.&nbsp;</p>",
