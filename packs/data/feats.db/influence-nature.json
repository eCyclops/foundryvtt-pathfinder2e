While you can’t directly control how you’ve influenced nature, you can hope for certain effects, such as easier hunts or birds falling silent whenever danger is approaching.</p>\n<p>If you’re legendary in Nature, you can elicit these same adjustments to animal behavior in the area by spending only 10 minutes.</p>",
