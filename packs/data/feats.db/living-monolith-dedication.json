You gain knowledge of Ancient Osirion and a connection to your nascent <em>ka stone</em>. If you fail a recovery check while dying, your dying condition does not increase; if you critically fail, your dying condition increases by only 1. You become trained in Ancient Osirion Lore, or expert if you were already trained.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the living monolith archetype.&nbsp;</p>",
