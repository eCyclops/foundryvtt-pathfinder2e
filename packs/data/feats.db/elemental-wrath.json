When you gain this feat, select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You can call to the land to cast the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gISYsBFby1TiXfBt]{Acid Splash} cantrip as an innate primal spell at will, except the spell has only verbal components and deals the type of damage you chose instead of acid damage; the spell gains the trait appropriate to its damage instead of the acid trait. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.&nbsp;</span></p>",
