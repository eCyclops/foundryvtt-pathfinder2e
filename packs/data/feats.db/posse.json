They gain a +1 circumstance bonus to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} your prey, to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.EA5vuSgJfiHH7plD]{Track} your prey, and to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.plBGdZhqq5JBl1D8]{Gather Information} about your prey. You and the creatures assisting you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls when entering combat with your prey.</p>\n<p>This benefit lasts until you designate a new prey or your prey dies, whichever comes first. An individual creature assisting you loses this benefit if theyâ€™re out of your presence for too long to benefit from your instructions. This is usually 1 hour, but is determined by the GM.</p>",
