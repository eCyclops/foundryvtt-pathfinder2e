By spending 1 hour working on a weapon or armor, you can grant it the effects of a <em>+1 potency</em> rune until your next daily preparations, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls for a weapon or increasing armorâ€™s item bonus to AC by 1. This has no effect if the weapon or armor already had a <em>potency</em> rune.</p>",
