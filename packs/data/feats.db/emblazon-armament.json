            "value": "<p>Carefully etching a sacred image into a physical object, you steel yourself for battle. You can spend 10 minutes emblazoning a symbol of your deity upon a weapon or shield. The symbol doesn’t fade until 1 year has passed, but if you Emblazon an Armament, any symbol you previously emblazoned and any symbol already emblazoned on that item instantly disappears. The item becomes a religious symbol of your deity and can be used as a divine focus while emblazoned, and it gains another benefit determined by the type of item. This benefit applies only to followers of the deity the symbol represents.</p>\n<p>•<strong> Shield</strong> The shield gains a +1 status bonus to its Hardness. (This causes it to reduce more damage with the Shield Block reaction.)</p>\n<p>• <strong>Weapon</strong> The wielder gains a +1 status bonus to damage rolls.</p>",
