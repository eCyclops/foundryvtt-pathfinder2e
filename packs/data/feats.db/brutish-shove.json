Make a Strike with a two-handed melee weapon. If you hit a target that is your size or smaller, that creature is flat-footed until the end of your current turn, and you can automatically Shove it, with the same benefits as the Shove action (including the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). If you move to follow the target, your movement doesnâ€™t trigger reactions. This Strike has the following failure effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target becomes flat-footed until the end of your current turn.</p>",
