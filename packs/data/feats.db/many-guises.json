Whenever you change your identity, instead of taking on your social or vigilante identity, you can become someone completely ordinary.</p>\n<p>This identity isn’t a specific individual—rather, you become a nondescript member of your ancestry, of any gender, with a neutral alignment and a mundane occupation such as common laborer, farmer, or peasant.</p>\n<p>Spells and abilities detect you as if you were this ordinary identity, rather than either of your two real identities, unless they succeed at a counteract check against your Deception DC. You can’t use either social abilities or vigilante abilities while in this identity.</p>",
