If you would automatically become trained in Acrobatics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.</p>\n<p>If you roll a success to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.kMcV8e5EZUxa6evt]{Squeeze}, you get a critical success instead. While youâ€™re Squeezing, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DCs against attempts to Shove you or otherwise move you from your space.</p>",
