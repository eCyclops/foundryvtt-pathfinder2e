This might have been a comprehensive education in formal setting, or the sort of education where you somehow obtain a number of scrolls and try not to explode anything you didn&rsquo;t mean to explode.</p>\n<p>You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uR62fVC9FyQAMCO1]{Trick Magic Item} feat, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to Trick scrolls. If you roll a critical failure to Trick a Magic Item that&rsquo;s a scroll, you get a failure instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can&rsquo;t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the scroll trickster archetype.</p>",
