When you successfully cast a non-cantrip hex that requires 2 actions or more to cast and that doesnâ€™t require a spell attack roll, if your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting activity you can make a nails @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strike} against the foe before applying any effects of the hex. If this Strike misses, the hex has no effect.</p>",
