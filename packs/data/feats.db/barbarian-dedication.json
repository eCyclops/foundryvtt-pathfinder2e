You become trained in barbarian class DC. You can use the Rage action (page 84). Choose an instinct as you would if you were a barbarian. You have that instinct for all purposes and become bound by its anathema, but you donâ€™t gain any of the other abilities it grants.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the barbarian archetype.</p>",
