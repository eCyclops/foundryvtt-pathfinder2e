If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores an amount of the target’s resistance equal to your level against all the following types of damage: chaotic, evil, good, lawful, negative, and positive.</p>\n<p>This applies to all damage the spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the positive energy within a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.x5rGOmhDRDVQPrnW]{Field of Life}. This doesn’t cause the spell to ignore immunities, only resistances.</p>",
