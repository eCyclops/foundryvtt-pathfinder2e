            "value": "<p>Your growing connection to your celestial forebears has granted you one of their resistances as well. Choose one of the following energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain resistance 5 to that damage type.</p>\n<p>Though you can choose any of these energy damage types, the damage type typically matches a celestial associated with your bloodline. For instance, an angelkin might choose resistance to cold or fire with a cassisian forebear, resistance to fire with a balisse forebear, or resistance to sonic with a choral forebear.</p>",
