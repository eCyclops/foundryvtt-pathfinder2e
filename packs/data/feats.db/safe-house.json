It’s in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave.</p>\n<p>The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has the effects of @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.EoKBlgf6Smt8opaU]{Nondetection}, using your Deception modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract level.</p>\n<p>Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime.</p>\n<p>The size of the safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you’re an expert in Deception, eight cubes if you’re a master, and 16 cubes if you’re legendary.</p>",
