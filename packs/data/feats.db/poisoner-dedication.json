You gain batches of infused reagents per day equal to your level. Your advanced alchemy level for creating these is 1 and doesn’t increase on its own.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can’t select another dedication feat until you have gained at least two other feats from the poisoner archetype.</p>",
