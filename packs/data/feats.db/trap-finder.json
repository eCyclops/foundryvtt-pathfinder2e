You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by traps, and to saves against traps. Even if you arenâ€™t @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.TiNDYUGlMmxzxBYU]{Searching}, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to be Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.</p>\n<p>You can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of master in Thievery. If you have master proficiency in Thievery, you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of legendary instead, and your circumstance bonuses against traps increase to +2.</p>",
