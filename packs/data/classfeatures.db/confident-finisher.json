You can use a finisher only if you have&nbsp;panache, and you lose your panache immediately after&nbsp;performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can&rsquo;t use&nbsp;actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn.</p>\n<p>Some actions with the finisher trait also grant an effect on&nbsp;a failure. Effects added on a failure don&rsquo;t apply on a critical&nbsp;failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose&nbsp;to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might&nbsp;do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.&nbsp;</p>",
