The two poisons can be up to six levels lower than your level, and you can’t use the poisons made without spending a batch of infused reagents via @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.LlZ5R50z9j8jysZL]{Perpetual Infusions)}. Applying the two poisons requires a separate action to apply each poison.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-family: Roboto, system, -apple-system, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">Once completed, you combine the two poisons on the weapon into a double poison with the lower of the two poisons’ DCs. This double poison is only virulent if both poisons were virulent, and if the poisons have a different number of stages, the double poison has a number of stages equal to the poison with the lower number of stages. The target takes the effects of both poisons for its current stage.&nbsp;</p>",
