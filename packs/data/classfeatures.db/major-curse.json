Immediately after completing the casting of a revelation spell while you are affected by your moderate curse, your curse progresses to its major effect, rather than overwhelming you. This effect lasts until you @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus}, which reduces your curse to its minor effect. If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of your major curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse.</p>\n<p>In addition, increase the number of Focus Points in&nbsp;your focus pool from 2 to 3. If you spend at least 2 Focus&nbsp;Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus&nbsp;Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>",
