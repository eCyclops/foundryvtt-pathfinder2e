In addition, you gain a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.qCEOZ6109Yo34tRx]{Formula Book (Blank)} for free and learn the formulas for two additional common 1st-level alchemical items, which must be elixirs or tools. Each time you gain a level, you learn the formula for one common alchemical elixir or alchemical tool of any level of item you can create.</p>\n<p>During your daily preparations, you can create a number of versatile vials—alchemical concoctions that can quickly be turned into elixirs and tools—equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.QHFMeJGzFWj2QczA]{Quick Tincture}action to turn one of these vials into an elixir or alchemical tool for which you know the formula.</p>",
