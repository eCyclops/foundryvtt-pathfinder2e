Increase the status bonus to your Speeds when&nbsp;you have panache to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus increases by 5 feet at 7th,&nbsp;11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don’t have panache, you still get half this status&nbsp;bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment.</p>",
