Add two common 10th-level divine spells to your&nbsp;repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can&nbsp;use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can’t use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.PExiZZTSP4p7TZaW]{Oracular Providence} feat to gain a second slot.</p>",
