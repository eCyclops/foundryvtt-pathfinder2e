You also gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.VaIHQzOE5ibmbtqU]{Wild Shape} druid feat. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.0xR9vrt6uDFl0Umo]{Wild Morph} order spell. Becoming fully domesticated by the temptations of civilization is anathema to your order. (This doesnâ€™t prevent you from buying and using processed goods or staying in a city for an adventure, but you can never come to rely on these conveniences or truly call such a place your permanent home.)</p>",
