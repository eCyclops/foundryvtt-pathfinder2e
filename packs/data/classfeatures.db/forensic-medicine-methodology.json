Information from bruising, bone fractures, blood spatters, and even the life cycle of carrion insects can provide valuable clues that help reconstruct the scene.</p>\n<p>You’re trained in Medicine and gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Ws9JlysHcFoz6WAQ]{Forensic Acumen} and @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.wYerMk6F1RZb0Fwt]{Battle Medicine} skill feats. When you use Battle Medicine, on a success the target recovers additional Hit Points equal to your level, and the target becomes temporarily immune for only 1 hour, not 1 day</p>",
