You might be a pickpocket working the streets, a cat burglar sneaking through windows and escaping via rooftops, or a safecracker breaking into carefully guarded vaults. You might even work as a consultant, testing clientsâ€™ defenses by trying to steal something precious.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">When a fight breaks out, you prefer swift, lightweight weapons, and you strike where it hurts. When you attack with a finesse melee weapon, you can add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">You are trained in Thievery.&nbsp;</span></p>",
