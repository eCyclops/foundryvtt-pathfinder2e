            "value": "<p>The long snouts that run in your family give you a keener sense of smell than most ratfolk. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine a creature’s location, as explained on page 465 of the Core Rulebook. The GM will usually double the range if you’re downwind from the creature or halve the range if you’re upwind.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} a creature or object within the range of your scent.</p>",
