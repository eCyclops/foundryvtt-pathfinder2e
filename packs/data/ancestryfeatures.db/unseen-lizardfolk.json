When youâ€™re in an area where your coloration is roughly similar to the environment (for instance, forest green in a forest), you can use the minor, single action application of this ability to make localized changes that help you blend into your surroundings, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks until your surroundings change in coloration or pattern.</p>",
