When you select this boon, it does not apply to your current character. Instead, select one of your Pathfinder Society characters with 0 XP. That character gains 12 XP, 12 Fame, 30 gp, and 12 Reputation to distribute among any number of legal factions.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can apply this benefit to the same character to whom you applied the Eager Prot&eacute;g&eacute; benefit, so long as that PC still has 12 XP. If you do so, you instead increase that character&rsquo;s XP by 12 (to 24 total), award them an additional 12 Reputation to distribute between one or more factions, and grant them an additional 45 gp (for a total of 75 gp).</p>",
