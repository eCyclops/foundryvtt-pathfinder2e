You have recruited a promising new agent to help research and publish your findings, which gives your assistant an extraordinary edge in their training.</p>\n<p>When you purchase this boon, select one of your Pathfinder Society characters with 12 or fewer XP who is not a field commissioned agent. That character gains one additional point to assign to their school training, for a total of 4 points.</p>",
