When you Create a Forgery, the GM rolls a secret DC 20 Society check. If you succeed, the forgery is of good enough quality that passive observers can&rsquo;t notice the fake. Only those who carefully examine the document and attempt a Perception or Society check against your Society DC can do so.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the document&rsquo;s handwriting doesn&rsquo;t need to be specific to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain up to a +4 circumstance bonus to your check, as well as to your DC (the GM determines the bonus). To forge a specific person&rsquo;s handwriting, you need a sample of that person&rsquo;s handwriting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your check result was below 20, the forgery has some obvious signs of being a fake, so the GM compares your result to each passive observer&rsquo;s Perception DC or Society DC, whichever is higher, using the success or failure results below. Once the GM rolls your check for a document, that same result is used against all passive observers&rsquo; DCs no matter how many creatures passively observe that document.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An observer who was fooled on a passive glance can still choose to closely scrutinize the documents on the lookout for a forgery, using different techniques and analysis methods beyond the surface elements you successfully forged with your original check. In that case, the observer can attempt a Perception or Society check against your Society DC (if they succeed, they know your document is a forgery).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Success The observer does not detect the forgery.</p>\n<p>Failure The observer knows your document is a forgery.</p>",
