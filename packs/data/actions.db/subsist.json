The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the place where you’re trying to Subsist. You might need a minimum proficiency rank to Subsist in particularly strange environments. Unlike most downtime activities, you can Subsist after 8 hours or less of exploration, but if you do, you take a –5 penalty.<br><br><strong>Critical Success</strong> You either provide a subsistence living for yourself and one additional creature, or you improve your own food and shelter, granting yourself a comfortable living.<br><strong>Success</strong> You find enough food and shelter with basic protection from the elements to provide you a subsistence living.<br><strong>Failure</strong> You’re exposed to the elements and don’t get enough food, becoming fatigued until you attain sufficient food and shelter.<br><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You attract trouble, eat something you shouldn’t, or otherwise worsen your situation. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to checks to Subsist for 1 week. You don’t find any food at all; if you don’t have any stored up, you’re in danger of starving or dying of thirst if you continue failing.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sample Subsist Tasks</h2>\n<p><strong>Untrained</strong> lush forest with calm weather or large city with plentiful resources<br><strong>Trained</strong> typical hillside or village<br><strong>Expert</strong> typical mountains or insular hamlet<br><strong>Master</strong> typical desert or city under siege<br><strong>Legendary</strong> barren wasteland or city of undead</p>",
