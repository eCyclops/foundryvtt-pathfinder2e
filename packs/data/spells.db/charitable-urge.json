If the target has no items on its person, the spell fails.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned} 1 as it wrestles with the urge.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> On its next turn, before it does anything else, the target must present the nearest creature with an item in its possession; the target chooses which item to give, and if the only item it has is one that it's currently using to defend itself, such as a weapon during a combat encounter, it can choose to be Stunned for 1 round instead of giving up the item. This might require the target to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} to retrieve an item or move to reach the nearest creature, and handing the item to the target always requires an Interact action.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the duration is 4 rounds, and the target must repeat the effects of failure on each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target can attempt a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, ending it entirely on a critical success.</p>",
