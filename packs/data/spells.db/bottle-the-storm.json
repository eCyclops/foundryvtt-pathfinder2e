You gain electricity resistance 10 against the triggering effect. If you successfully prevent damage in this way, at any time during the spellâ€™s duration, you can spend a single action, which has the attack trait, to expend the charge and make a melee spell attack at an adjacent target or a ranged spell attack at a target within 60 feet. This attack deals electricity damage equal to the damage prevented by <em>bottle the storm</em>. If you cast <em>bottle the storm</em> a second time before the original duration elapses, or if you do not make this attack, the stored charge dissipates harmlessly.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The resistance increases to 15, and you can immediately make the spell attack roll granted by <em>bottle the storm</em> as part of the reaction used to cast the spell.<br><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> The resistance increases to 20, and you can immediately make the spell attack roll granted by <em>bottle the storm</em> as part of the reaction used to cast the spell.&nbsp;</p>",
