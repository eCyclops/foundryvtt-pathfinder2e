            "value": "<p>Few incantations are as renowned as the power to create worlds.&nbsp;To cast this ritual, you must be on the Astral Plane, the Ethereal&nbsp;Plane, or a plane that connects to one of the two.</p>\n<p>A demiplane created with this ritual exists on the Astral or&nbsp;Ethereal Plane. It can have the appearance of any mundane&nbsp;environment or structure, such as a glorious cathedral, a&nbsp;clearing in a forest, a comfortably furnished cavern, or anything&nbsp;else one can imagine. All demiplanes have finite, unbreachable&nbsp;boundaries, which might resemble stone, wood, or something&nbsp;more unnatural, such as a wall of mist or unceasing void.</p>\n<p>Demiplanes have environmental conditions as appropriate&nbsp;for the Material Plane, though the primary caster can dictate a&nbsp;general climate or light level, as well as whether the demiplane&nbsp;experiences seasons or a day-night cycle. The demiplane has&nbsp;no native plants or animals, but they can be introduced, and&nbsp;plants will grow in a demiplane’s light.</p>\n<p>When you first cast create demiplane, the casters are teleported to the demiplane. The demiplane has no direct access to other worlds, so @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.5bTt2CvYHPvaR7QQ]{Plane Shift} or similar abilities are necessary to access it. As part of casting the ritual to create a new demiplane, you create a key to the demiplane which serves as a plane shift tuning fork for that demiplane. Most resemble ornate keys, but some take the forms of maps, compasses, or dowsing rods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have the original key to an existing demiplane and&nbsp;are on that demiplane, you can instead use this ritual to&nbsp;either expand the demiplane or add special traits or features&nbsp;described on page 242. See pages 136–138 of the Gamemastery&nbsp;Guide for more information about these planar features.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alignment</strong> The demiplane gains one alignment trait, such&nbsp;as lawful or good.</li>\n<li><strong>Bounteous </strong>The demiplane has a functional ecosystem,&nbsp;with plants and animals appropriate to the environment.&nbsp;This ecosystem doesn’t require any additional effort on&nbsp;your part to maintain.</li>\n<li><strong>Elemental</strong> The demiplane gains the air, earth, fire, or water&nbsp;planar essence trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Gravity </strong>The demiplane gains a gravity trait of your choice.</li>\n<li><strong>Key </strong>You create an additional key that can be used to&nbsp;access the demiplane with plane shift and improve it&nbsp;with create demiplane.</li>\n<li><strong>Portal </strong>You create a permanent gateway between the&nbsp;demiplane and a single other location. You must spend&nbsp;the ritual’s casting time constructing the gateway on&nbsp;the external side, which typically resembles an arch or&nbsp;doorway of some sort. The gate is always active, but it can&nbsp;be secured as you would any door.</li>\n<li><strong>Scope</strong> The demiplane can be unbounded instead of finite,&nbsp;though still with the same size.<hr></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You create a new demiplane whose area&nbsp;consists of two contiguous squares, each 100 feet on a side. The ceiling is 20 feet high. If modifying an existing demiplane,&nbsp;you can instead either add this area to the demiplane’s size or&nbsp;add two special traits or features.</p>\n<p><strong>Success </strong>As critical success, but the demiplane’s area is a single&nbsp;square, 100 feet on a side and a ceiling 20 feet high. If&nbsp;modifying an existing demiplane, you can add one special trait&nbsp;or feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure </strong>The ritual has no effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Something goes horribly wrong, and all casters&nbsp;are teleported to an unknown but likely hostile plane.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th) </strong>The ritual creates a square area 1,000 feet on&nbsp;a side, with a ceiling 20 feet high (two contiguous areas of&nbsp;this size on a critical success). The cost of the ritual increases&nbsp;to 20,000 gp</p>",
