Anyone passing through the area gains the following benefits against harmful effects of the terrain and environment, including environmental damage, hazardous terrain, and hazards in the area. The spell grants a +2 status bonus to AC and saves against such effects, and resistance 5 to all damage from such effects. Furthermore, the spell prevents anything in the area that’s prone to collapse, such as a rickety bridge or an unstable ceiling, from collapsing, except under extreme strain that would collapse a normal structure of its type.</p>\n<p><em>Safe passage</em> protects only against harm, not inconvenience, and it doesn’t reduce difficult terrain, remove the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionspf2e.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} condition caused by precipitation, or the like, nor does it protect against creatures within the spell’s area.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The granted resistance increases to 10, and the area can be 120 feet long.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> The granted resistance increases to 15, and the area can be 500 feet long.</p>",
