If it's at least 4 levels lower than you, you can make it a minion which gives it the minion trait. You can have a maximum of four minions under your control. If it doesn't become a minion, you can give it one simple command that it pursues single-mindedly. If you aren't a follower of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.GX6PF9ifR47Xyjg9]{Norgorber}, it ignores any of your subsequent commands. A follower of Norgorber can give the skinstitch simple commands by presenting a @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.upzjwQ96cZG0Xlmx]{Religious Symbol} of the deity and commanding it with a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, except a skinstitch that doesn't become your minion stays in place and attacks anyone that attacks or tries to move it, rather than following your command.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to create the skinstitch.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You create the skinstitch, but it goes berserk and attempts to kill you, ignoring your commands even if you are a follower of Norgorber.</span></p>",
