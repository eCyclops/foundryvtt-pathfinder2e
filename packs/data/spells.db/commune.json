You can ask up to seven questions that could be answered with “Yes” or “No.” The entity is likely to know answers related to its purview; a servitor of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.swwwP7eVmlNuWTb7]{Gozreh} would likely know about unnatural weather patterns and a servitor of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.JgqH3BhuEuA4Zyqs]{Desna}&nbsp;would likely know someone’s travel route. The entity answers with one word answers such as “Yes,” “No,” “Likely,” and “Unknown,” though its answers always reflect its own agenda and could be deceptive.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Critical Success</strong> You contact a more powerful entity aligned strongly with your interests, possibly even your deity. The entity won’t attempt to deceive you, though it still might not know the answers. When it’s important to provide clarity, the entity will answer your questions with up to five words, such as “If you leave immediately” or “That was true once.”<br><strong>Success</strong> You can ask your questions and receive answers.<br><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to contact a planar entity.<br><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You are exposed to the enormity of the cosmos and are stupefied 4 for 1 week (can’t remove by any means).</span></p>",
