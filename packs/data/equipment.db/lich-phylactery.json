            "value": "<p><span>This item is crafted by a spellcaster who wishes to become a lich. When a lich is destroyed, its soul flees to the phylactery. The phylactery then rebuilds the lich’s undead body over the course of 1d10 days. Afterward, the lich manifests next to the phylactery, fully healed and in a new body (therefore, it lacks any equipment it had on its old body). A lich’s phylactery must be destroyed to prevent a lich from returning.<br></span></p>\n<p><span>The standard phylactery is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment inscribed with magical phrases. This box has Hardness 9 and 36 HP, but some liches devise more durable or difficult-to-obtain phylacteries. A phylactery might also come in the form of a ring, an amulet, or a similar item; the specifics are up to the creator.</span></p>",
