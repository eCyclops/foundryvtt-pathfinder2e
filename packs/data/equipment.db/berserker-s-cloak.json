When worn, the cloak drapes over your head and around your shoulders, imbuing you with a bearâ€™s ferocity. If you have the Rage action, while raging you grow jaws that deal 1d10 piercing damage and claws that deal 1d6 slashing damage and have the agile trait. This transformation is a morph effect, and both the jaws and claws are unarmed attacks in the brawling weapon group. You gain the benefits of a <em>+1 weapon potency</em> rune and a <em>striking</em> rune with these attacks (gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and increasing the weapon damage dice by&nbsp;one).<br></span></p>\n<p><span>If you have an animal instinct and the bestial rage instinct ability, instead of gaining these unarmed attacks, your unarmed attacks from the bestial rage instinct ability gain the benefits of a <em>+2 weapon potency</em> rune and a <em>greater striking</em> rune (granting a +2 item bonus to attack rolls and increasing the weapon damage dice by two).<br></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> You are a barbarian with the animal instinct.</span></p>",
