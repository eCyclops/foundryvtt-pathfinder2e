When activated, it briefly appears in its true form: a golden chain with golden spheres attached by fine threads.</p>\n<p>This necklace has one [[/r 8d6 #fire]], one [[/r 6d6 #fire]] and two [[/r 4d6 #fire]] beads with a Reflex save DC of 25. When all the beads are gone, the necklace becomes a non-magical hemp string.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span style=\"font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;\">A</span> Interact; <strong>Effect</strong> You detach a sphere from the necklace, causing it to glow with orange light. After you activate a sphere, if you or anyone else hurls it (an Interact action with the ranged trait), it detonates as a fireball where it lands. Your toss can place the center of the fireballed trait), it detonates as a fireball where it lands. Your toss can place the center of the fireball anywhere within 70 feet, though at the GMâ€™s discretion you might need to make an attack roll if the throw is unusually challenging. If no one hurls the sphere by the start of your next turn, it turns into a non-magical red bead.</p>",
