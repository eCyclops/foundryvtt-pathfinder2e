Two handles on either side, each with a small button, allow you to aim the spotlight outward from your body.<br></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Activate</strong> <span style=\"font-family: 'Pathfinder2eActions'; font-size: 1.8em; display: inline;\">A</span> Interact; <strong>Frequency</strong> Once per hour; <strong>Effect</strong> When you push the left-hand button, the <em>inspiring spotlight</em> emits a beam of bright magical light in a&nbsp;120-foot line that hangs in the air and remains in place even if you move the spotlight. If the line passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, the <em>inspiring spotlight</em> attempts to counteract the darkness. Creatures within the line gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, creatures in the line who are frightened reduce the value of their frightened condition by 1 at the beginning of each turn they start in the area of the line. The beam remains in place for 1 minute or until you push the right-hand button with another Interact action to extinguish the light.&nbsp;</span></p>",
