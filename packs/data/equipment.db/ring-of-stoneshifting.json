A <em>ring of stoneshifting</em> grants you the ability to ignore difficult terrain caused by rubble or uneven ground made of stone and earth.<br></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute; <strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day; <strong>Requirements</strong> You are standing on at least 5 feet of earthen material (such as stone, soil, clay, or sand); <strong>Effect</strong> You sink into the ground and emerge at another location within 100 miles. This location must have an earthen surface at least 5 feet deep and you must be able to identify the location precisely by both its position relative to your starting position and its appearance or other identifying features. You canâ€™t carry extradimensional spaces with you to the destination, and if you attempt to do so, the activation fails.&nbsp;</span></p>",
